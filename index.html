    <h1>Daddy Bender, we're hungry.</h1>

    <main>
        <p>
            Why would I want to know that? And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. No! The cat shelter's on to me.  
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Is that a cooking show?</li>
            <li>Hey, guess what you're accessories to. I'm Santa Claus! Really?! Good luck with that. </li>
            <li>All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter and was extremely busy.</li>
